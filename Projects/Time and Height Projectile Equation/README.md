# TimeHeightPE
This C++ program is similar to PMRange and PMVelocity in that the program will output an objects range (in feet), time spent in the air (in seconds), and the object’s maximum height (in feet).  Use these projectile motion formulas: R=(v2/g) sin 2Θ T=R/(v cos Θ) H=(v sin Θ) T/2 – ½ g (T/2)2 This program also calculates the (x,y) points the object is in from the beginning of its launch to the end of its launch. The program calculates this using the following equations: x=(v cos Θ) t y = (v sin Θ) t – ½ g t2
