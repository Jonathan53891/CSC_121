# ChangingBaseNumbers
This program allows the user to input an integer value and a corresponding base number as the user wishes. The program then re-calculate the integer into the requested base number system. (For instance, inputting the number 10 and the base 2 will output 1100101, or inputting the number 130 and the base 18 will output H4.)
