# EncryptDecrypt
This program prompts the user for the name of an input file and encryption key chosen by the user. This encrypts the inputted message to an unrecognizable code generated by the computer. The program is then ultimately able to decrypt the generated message and output the message that the user inputted previously. 

Please note that to run this program, it will require three (3) .txt files (ex. "test.txt, test2.txt, & test3.txt"). For instance, text.txt can store a message that can be encrypted and outputted into text2.txt. The encrypted message can be taken from test2.txt and be outputted into test3.txt as the decrypted message the user initially started with.
