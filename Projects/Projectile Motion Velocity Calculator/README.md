# PMVelocity
This introductory C++ program is similar to PMRange, as this program measures the velocity of an object using the projectile motion equation V=sqrt (2 g (h1 â€“ h2)) where g is acceleration due to gravity, h1 is the height of the hill in either meters or feet, &amp; h2 are the different heights the object travels to.
