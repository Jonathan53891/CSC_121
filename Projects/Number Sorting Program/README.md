# NumberSorting
This program compares the time required to sort a vector of integers using three sorting methods (bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort). It also records the times it takes for each sorting method to sort through the vector of integers. Lastly, it prints the times that the different sorting methods took to sort the integers. This ultimately proves that the insertion sorting method is the best of the three options (or - arguably more importantly - that the bubble sort method is the worst of the three options), but this program was created to fully prove that idea.
