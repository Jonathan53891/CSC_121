# GeometricShapes
This program displays a menu of geometric shapes (cube, sphere, prism, cylinder, cone). The program allows the user to choose a shape. It also prompts the user to enter the dimensions of the shape. The program calculates the shapeâ€™s area and volume based on the values the user inputs, and it allows the program to immediately re-start the program and/or to quit the program.
