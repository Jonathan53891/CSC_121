# PlanetAccelerationComparison
This program allows the user to input two different planets. The user will give a diameter and mass for their respective planets. The program then stores them in a private class, calls it out, and outputs the planetsâ€™ surface area, density, and gravity. The program also compares the two planets and states which planet has the greater gravity value.
