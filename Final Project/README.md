# FinalProject
This program allows you to keep track of a group of planets. 
It displays a menu that allows you to
  1) add a planet 
  2) delete a planet 
  3) search for a particular planet 
  4) display one particular planet and description of that requested planet 
  5) sort the whole list of planets in alphabetical order 
  6) save a new planet to the file 
  7) quit the program.

This program is similar to a previously posted project (PlanetAccelerationComparison). 
This program stores the planet’s name, diameter, and mass, and stores the list in a vector. 
Classes were added to provide functions to calculate the 
  - surface area of the planet
  - density of the planet
  - acceleration due to gravity at the planet’s surface (g)
